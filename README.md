The task in this project was to identify the correlation between release year of the films and their duration. At first, it looked like from 2011 to year 2020 the length of the movies has decreased indicating a clear negative correlation but when we take the length of release a bit too far then picture becomes too hazy. Final result was drawn from the category or genre of the movies, it is seen from analysis that after 2000s number of Documentary, Children movies has increased which are suppossed to be shorter in length,creating this negative correlation.
